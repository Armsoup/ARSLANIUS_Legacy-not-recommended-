# ARSLANIUS Legacy (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**WARNING:** This repository is a digital museum. The code here is outdated, inefficient, and full of bugs. It is preserved only for historical purposes to show the evolution of the project.

> **DO NOT USE THESE VERSIONS FOR REAL TASKS.**
> For the modern, self-healing, and powerful OS, go to: [ARSLANIUS Main Repository](https://github.com/Armsoup/ARSLANIUS)

## What is this?
This is a collection of the very first prototypes of the ARSLANIUS system (Versions 1.0 to 15.0). 
Back then, there was:
* No **SFC_Daemon** (No self-healing)
* No **ArslanScript** (No compiler/interpreter)
* No **as-pack** (No archiver)
* Just simple Batch menus and basic logic.

---

## Content
All legacy versions are packed into a single **.zip** archive for convenience. 
* **Versions 1-10:** Early experiments.
* **Versions 11-15:** First attempts at a user system and file management.

---

## Why keep it?
To show the contrast. If you look at **ARSLANIUS 15** and then open **ARSLANIUS 16**, you will see a massive leap in architecture and logic.
